          For my last few years at university I worked at Roger Gracie Academy, a world famous Brazilian Jiu Jitsu academy in London. My
          responsibilities include carrying out duties at the front desk and building and maintaining the academy's website. As well as working there,
          I have been training for around 3 years.

          When I was 17 I set up a food stall for Notting Hill Carnival. Over the years my love for cooking turned into a small catering company that
          I ran, doing dinner parties and small events for people around London. I set up the business myself and have learnt the ropes of hospitality
          and management on the job. We catered for anything from 4 to 30 people.

          Over 6 weeks I worked as a runner during the production of Episodes, Showtime & BBC. Logistics and maintaining the smooth flow of the shoot
          were my main responsibilities. Being a team player amongst a crew of around 40 was essential, whilst strong motivation and diplomacy were
          needed for the early starts and long hours each day.
