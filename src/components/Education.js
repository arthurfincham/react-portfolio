        <h3>...more on Makers</h3>
        <p>
          After teaching myself some basics of programming, I applied to Makers: a 16 week highly selective development bootcamp.
          <br />
          <br />
          We began with <span className="text-darker">TDD</span> in <span className="text-darker">Ruby</span> and{' '}
          <span className="text-darker">Rspec</span> before moving to <span className="text-darker">OOD</span>, databases and web development. By the
          end of the course, I was confident and competent in building a full-stack application.
          <br />
          <br />
          While I could have taught myself some of the programming skills, I felt that the experience of{' '}
          <span className="text-darker">Pair Programming</span> and collaborating with other was invaluable.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our cohort was hybrid, meaning that our second of three projects was done remotely. Using <span className="text-darker">Agile</span>{' '}
          methodologies through tools like Trello and <span className="text-darker">GitHub</span>, we made good progress and got a taste of working in
          the real world.
